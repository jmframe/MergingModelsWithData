Dear CEE - 298:

The last homework is due on Wednesday, next week.

It will consist of programming the different model averaging methods in
the attached paper. All information is available in the paper to implement
the various methods. Try to implement as much as you can; I understand
that BMA is particularly difficult to do, but try to resolve this as much
as you can. You have your own Differential Evolution and MCMC code to
resolve the weights of the different models for the different model
averaging methods. I will likely curve this last homework.

Info required to the do homework:

I am attaching a data set (data.txt) of ensemble streamflow forecasts of
eight different conceptual rainfal - runoff models. The actual
measurements are contained in the file Y.txt;

I am also attaching a paper in 2007 that describes the different models
(also in the example of the attached slides discussed in class). The first
column is the abc model the last column of data is the SAC-SMA model.
Eight years was used for calibration (n = 8 * 365, in the model averaging
paper). Use the first 8 years for calibration of the weights and the last
part of the data set to evaluate the performance of the model averaging
method; the Root Mean Square Error of the mean forecast.

Write a code that reports the weights for each method and the
corresponding quality of the fit of the prediction of the model averaging
method for the calibration and evaluation period.

Good luck,
Jasper
